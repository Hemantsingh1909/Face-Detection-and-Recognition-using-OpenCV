# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-using-OpenCV
Face Detection and Recognition from an image or a video is a popular topic in computer vision. Face recognition technology has widely attracted attention due to its enormous application value and market potential, such as real-time video surveillance systems. It is widely acknowledged that face recognition has played an important role in the surveillance systems as it doesn’t need the object’s co-operation. We design a real-time face recognition system based on input camera and image set algorithm by way of OpenCV and Python programming development. The system includes three parts: Detection module, training module and 
recognition module.
